A good way to start contributing to Readapt is to create an issue. Normally you'd create an issue in cases if:

2. You have an idea and/or you'd like to create new features

### 1.1 Issue: bug report

When creating an issue for a bug report, it's advisable to structure the issue from 4 main parts.  

1. *Brief description*: describe shorty the bug you've encountered
2. *Actual behavior*: describe in more detail the buggy behavior. On top of that reproduction steps, photos and/or videos of the application behavior are welcome.
3. *Expected behavior*: how the application should have been working if the bug wasn't present.
4. *Running environment*: give information about the environment where the application runs: application version, browser name and version, OS name and version, and any other information that you seem relevent.

### 1.2 Issue: new feature idea

Feature ideas are great because they make Readapt more useful for the users.  

Normally you can include the following information in a fueature idea issue:

1. *Brief description*: describe shortly your idea
2. *User benefits*: how the user benefits from this feature
3. *Existing solutions*: if there are other application that have implemented this feature, please let us know about those.
