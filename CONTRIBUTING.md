# Welcome to Readapt contributing guide

Thank you for your time and interest in contributing to the Readapt project. Any contrubution, either creating a bug report or coding is welcome! 

Before continuing, please read our [Contributor Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to make our community respectful and welcoming for everyone.  

In this guide you'll find helpful information on how to create issues, pull requests, and understand the coding practices used in the Readapt project.  

## 1. Opening an issue

A good way to start contributing to Readapt is to create an issue: create a bug report and suggest an idea.

### 1.1 Issue: bug report

When creating an issue for a bug report, it's advisable to structure the issue from 4 main parts.  

1. *Brief description*: describe shorty the bug you've encountered;
2. *Actual behavior*: describe in more detail the buggy behavior. Bug reproduction steps, photos and/or videos of the are welcome;
3. *Expected behavior*: how the application should work if the bug wasn't present;
3. *Logs*: if you have access to application logs (e.g. any errors in the console);
4. *Running environment*: give information about the environment where the application runs: application version, browser name and version, OS name and version, and any other information that you seem relevent.

### 1.2 Issue: new feature idea

Feature ideas are great because they make Readapt more useful for the users.  

Please include the following information in a feature idea issue:

1. *Brief description*: describe shortly your idea;
2. *User benefits*: how the user benefits from this feature;
3. *Existing solutions*: please share other applications that have the new feature idea already implemented.

If you are a software developer and you'd like to implement the feature by yourself: you're welcome! But before jumping into the code, it's highly advisable to create an feature idea first to discuss it with us.  

## 3. Development environment setup

Readapt repository is a [lerna](https://lerna.js.org/)-based monorepo consisting of packages and apps.

Here are the steps you need to perform to setup your environment setup:

1. Have Node.js version `16` installed.
