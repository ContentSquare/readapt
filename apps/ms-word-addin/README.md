# MS Word Add-In

## Introduction

Created by [Contentsquare Foundation](https://contentsquare-foundation.org/), Readapt is a software platform that aims to help those with reading challenges like dyslexia to more easily read digital text. The [Microsoft Word version](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA200004098?tab=Overview) of Readapt allows users to set their reading preferences and see an adaptation of the Word document's text. It also provides reading tools like a screen mask and reading ruler. 

## Operating system and Microsoft Office compatibility
### MacOS 
Readapt can be used on most recent releases of MacOS and Microsoft Office.

### Microsoft Office Online
[Microsoft Office Online](www.office.com) (offered free of charge from Microsoft) can be used with Readapt.

### Microsoft Windows & Microsoft Office
Readapt can be used with certain combinations of Windows and Microsoft Office. Because Microsoft Office add-ins [use an embedded browser control](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/concepts/browsers-used-by-office-web-add-ins), the browser installed on your version of Windows can also determine if you can use Readapt. We strongly recommend installing the [latest version of Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge) (free from Microsoft) for the best Readapt experience if you use Microsoft Windows. See below for a summary of whatâ€™s compatible. Unfortunately, versions of Microsoft Windows and Office not mentioned below are not compatible with Readapt.
